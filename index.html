                    <p>Greetings, world! My name is Abdulsalam, and I'm excited to share my experience with the HNG internship program as I delve into the frontend development field. This chance is a springboard for my goals, not merely a stepping stone. Allow me to explain my motives, how HNG will support my development, and the objectives I have set for this thrilling journey.</p>

                    <h3>Motivation for becoming a Front-End developer</h3>
                    <p>
                        I participated in the I4G X Zuri Training a few years ago, where I received training to become a UX designer. Every stage of the program was enjoyable to me. My first significant move into the tech industry was this training. Since then, I've worked to improve my abilities as much as possible while juggling practice and coursework.
                        I've been fascinated by how beautiful websites are organized and constructed ever since I came over a video a little more than a year ago showing a man creating a SAAS website from scratch using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I've been learning this through YouTube, but the videos haven't really connected with what I'm trying to learn or had a big impact.

                    </p>
                    <h3>How HNG will help you grow in the field</h3>
                    <p>
                        HNG offers a clear and organized learning environment where I can sharpen my skills without feeling lost. The program includes hands-on experience with real projects that will challenge me and encourage creative thinking.
                        Mentorship is also crucial for my success. With guidance from experienced developers, I’ll gain valuable insights and feedback. Plus, there are plenty of networking opportunities!
                    </p>
                    <h3>Your goals for the internship and how you plan to achieve them</h3>
                    <p>
                        Being able to learn from top pros at HNG is like having an inside look into the brains of experts in the FE field The curriculum encourages me to think creatively by providing a defined study route with real-world exposure through projects.
                        Another excellent advantage is mentoring. I hope to receive guidance from seasoned developers who will offer insights that books and random videos from the internet cannot provide. Additionally, there are many opportunities to network and i hope to make the most of it
